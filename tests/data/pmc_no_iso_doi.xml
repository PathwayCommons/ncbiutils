          <title>Importance</title>
          <p>Following the recent expansion of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, this remote model of care in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery will likely remain and continue to evolve.</p>
          <sec>
            <title>Objective</title>
            <p>This study was conducted to assess patients&#x2019; perceptions of and willingness to participate in a synchronous telemedicine visit beyond the COVID-19 pandemic for women with pelvic floor disorders.</p>

            <title>Study Design</title>
            <p>We conducted a cross-sectional study of women who completed a synchronous telemedicine visit from March 16 through May 22, 2020, at a urogynecology practice in an academic medical center. An electronic survey was distributed to women after all telemedicine visits. Demographic data, visit type, and survey responses were analyzed.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec>
            <title>Results</title>
            <p>Two hundred two women received the survey, and 135 women completed it (response rate of 66.8%). The mean age of the respondents was 62.9 &#xB1; 16.4 years, and the 3 most common visit diagnoses were overactive bladder (43.7%), stress urinary incontinence (22.2%), and pelvic organ prolapse (21.4%). Most survey participants (88.9%) found that the quality of their telemedicine visits was better than expected, and 89.6% reported that they would like to continue telemedicine care. Our survey showed that 19.4% of women reported difficulty with technology.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec>
            <title>Conclusions</title>
            <p>We found that most women presenting for synchronous telemedicine urogynecology care had a positive visit experience and would continue to use telemedicine for their care. Further developmental work needs to be done on improving the ease of technology as well as availability of telemedicine in the care of women affected by pelvic floor disorders.</p>

      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic and the enactment of the Federal Emergency Act in March of 2020 catalyzed the use of telemedicine.

          <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
        </sup> With the easing of policy restrictions on the use of telemedicine, many health care systems across the United States redistributed resources to build the necessary infrastructure for virtual care visits. Most health care providers were then mandated to adopt this model to optimize care delivery.

          <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
        </sup> Through this process, many clinicians experienced telemedicine care benefits, including cost-effectiveness and shorter visits without sacrificing clinical efficacy and patient satisfaction.

          <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
        </sup> Previous telemedicine studies have not shown a loss of clinical care quality with virtual delivery.

          <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
        </sup> Furthermore, although telemedicine for female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (FPMRS) is not a novel concept, previous virtual visits have been limited to investigational initiatives and rural settings.

          <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
        </sup> With the temporary nature of the Federal Emergency Act, we sought to use this unprecedented time to answer if FPMRS patients believe that synchronous telemedicine care is a desirable alternative for health care delivery beyond the pandemic.

        <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
        <p>This study is a cross-sectional survey of patients who completed a synchronous telemedicine visit from March 16, 2020, through May 22, 2020, at an academic FPMRS clinic. We distributed the electronic survey using the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) survey tool to patients who presented for telemedicine visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>On March 16, 2020, the FPMRS ambulatory in-person clinic underwent a mandated transition to synchronous telemedicine care for all nonurgent patients. The hospital underwent a system-wide implementation of synchronous videoconferencing through the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act&#x2013;compliant platforms. Alternatively, telephone calls without a video connection were used for those patients whose visits could not be completed through video technology. Synchronous visits are a telehealth model between the patient and the clinician designed to occur simultaneously. All patients were encouraged to participate in synchronous video telemedicine care without exceptions. Even those patients who needed in-person follow-up examinations were encouraged to establish care with an initial telemedicine visit. Call-in video or telephone translator services were used for those who needed an interpretation service for their telemedicine visits. In advance of the telemedicine visit, participants received written instructions from our administrative team and phone-based technology support at the time of the visit.</p>
        <p>In addition to the survey, we collected basic demographic data and patients&#x2019; answers to the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory. Visit information during the study period, including the types and length of the visit and the billing diagnoses, were also collected by reviewing the electronic health record. After the telemedicine visit on the same day, patients were invited to participate in the electronic survey using an automatically generated link. If the participant had more than 1 telemedicine visit during the study period, we included the survey based on her first telemedicine visit experience only. Survey completion was voluntary, and no financial compensation was provided. The survey was specifically designed to assess participants&#x2019; perceptions of telemedicine use in an FPMRS clinic and their willingness to continue this model beyond the period of social distancing and government recommended restrictions. The perceptions were measured using a 3-point Likert scale (&#x201C;definitely agree,&#x201D; &#x201C;somewhat agree,&#x201D; &#x201C;disagree&#x201D;) by asking participants about their experiences of using telemedicine in FPMRS in similarity to what has previously been reported in prior studies.

            <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
          </sup> The survey construction was reviewed by the consortium of 8 FPMRS clinicians in our practice and experts in survey clinical research and the Health Education Project Specialist within the Patient and Family Learning Center at Mass General Brigham to promote straightforward language uses.
        </p>
        <p>Basic descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographics of the response population. Normally distributed continuous data are summarized using means and standard deviations; one variable (distance to the hospital) was skewed and is summarized using a median and interquartile range. Categorical data are summarized with the frequency and percentage of their occurrence. Differences between responders and nonresponders were analyzed using independent
          <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> tests for continuous data and &#x3C7;
          <sup>2</sup> tests for categorical data; the Fisher exact test was used when small cell sizes were present for race/ethnicity analyses. Willingness to continue with telemedicine was recoded to create a binary variable. Participants responding either &#x201C;yes&#x2014;with telephone only,&#x201D; &#x201C;yes&#x2014;with video,&#x201D; or &#x201C;yes&#x2014;with either&#x201D; to the willingness to continue question were coded as willing to continue. Those responding &#x201C;no&#x201D; were coded as unwilling to continue. Those responding &#x201C;my doctor/nurse practitioner requested me to have an in-person visit the next time&#x201D; were excluded from analyses using this binary indicator of willingness. The fisher exact test was used to analyze differences in the 8 key perception questions between willing and unwilling participants to continue with telemedicine. All tests were 2-sided, and
          <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap hosted at Mass General Brigham health care,

          <title>Characteristics of Patients Participating in Telemedicine</title>
          <p>During the study period, 135 of 202 respondents (66.8%) completed the survey. The respondents&#x2019; mean age was 62.9 &#xB1; 16.4 years. The majority were White non-Hispanic (85.9%), and 96.3% did not require an interpreter to complete the survey (Table
            <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Seventy-six participants (56.3%) were 65 years or older, and 59 participants (43.7%) were younger than 65 years. Most participants (49.6%) used a smartphone, followed by a personal computer (26.7%) for their telemedicine visit. Ninety participants (66.7%) lived within a 20-mile radius of the main hospital in Boston, MA. Although the majority (94.1%) lived within a 100-mile radius of the hospital, 8 participants (5.9%) lived more than 100 miles away, and 5 participants lived more than 500 miles away. The average Charlson Comorbidity Score among all respondents was 2.9 (SD, 2.3). The 5 most common visit diagnoses managed during this period included the following: overactive bladder (43.7%), stress urinary incontinence (22.2%), pelvic organ prolapse (21.4%), genitourinary syndrome of menopause (20.0%), and pessary care (13.3%) (Table

          <p>Twenty-one respondents (15.6%) were considered &#x201C;neutral&#x201D; on the willingness question and excluded because they were told that they needed to have an in-person evaluation after their telemedicine visit. One hundred fourteen responses were analyzed for willingness to participate in future telemedicine visits. Most participants (88.5%) reported that they would continue to receive urogynecology care through the telemedicine platform (Fig.
            <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Participants&#x2019; willingness to continue telemedicine care was high regardless of the age group, 65 years and older or younger than 65 years (87.5% and 90.0%, respectively;

        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Since the beginning of the social distancing order, our practice has rapidly adapted to using a synchronous telemedicine model for all nonemergent FPMRS ambulatory visits. During this period, most participants had a positive experience with telemedicine and were willing to continue their FPMRS telemedicine care after the pandemic. More specifically, the participants who were satisfied with the telemedicine visit&#x2019;s overall quality and decreased travel time were more likely to want to participate in telemedicine care in the future.</p>
        <p>Unlike previous descriptive studies on synchronized telemedicine care in FPMRS, this study did not limit the participant pool to visit type or visit diagnoses.

            <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
          </sup> Both established and new consult patients were included in the analysis, and both groups reported similarly positive perceptions of telemedicine care. This positive perception was also similar among the participants regardless of their age, comorbidities, previous exposure to telemedicine, or the distance from our facility, further increasing the generalizability of telemedicine&#x2019;s application.
        </p>
        <p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine was used to provide health care in resourceless and remote parts of the country by eliminating physicians or patients&#x2019; need to travel for medical care. However, recent temporary suspensions on telemedicine restrictions allowed us to experience the merits of telemedicine and support those advocating for the expansion of the model beyond the pandemic period. Although it is important to note that a patient&#x2019;s distance from our clinic was positively associated with how they answered the willingness question, it is also notable for remarking that the perception with most agreement regardless of the distance from the clinic was that telemedicine decreases travel time. This finding aligns with previous studies that found telemedicine can reduce medical transportation-associated health care costs.
          <sup>
            <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,

          </sup>
        </p>
        <p>The temporary expansion of telemedicine also relieved the licensure restrictions, allowing health care providers to see patients across state lines without being licensed by the state where the patient is located.
          <sup>
            <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
            <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
          </sup> Therefore, we were able to provide not only continued care for our established patients, but we were also able to establish new patient relationships without patients having to travel to a metropolis location. This enhanced access to health care may dissipate health care disparities by increasing access to high-volume medical centers that are often in urban settings.

          <sup>
            <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
          </sup> estimated that 20% of older adults were unready for telemedicine care. This study cited that unreadiness was associated with men, poorer self-reported health, and residing in a nonmetropolitan area. Similarly, our study found that 19.4% of respondents reported having technical difficulties. Albeit anecdotal, the older patients (&#x2265;65 years) often needed more time connecting onto the video platform, which we hypothesized to have a negative impact on their perception of the visit. However, our results showed the contrary. Older age or difficulty connecting to telemedicine did not impact the acceptance of telemedicine. This finding may be secondary to selection bias because participants accepted telemedicine in lieu of delaying care. In addition, the nationwide advertisement of the telemedicine model during COVID-19, the transition of nonmedical public systems to virtual services, and increased availability for telemedicine infrastructures may have effectively lowered the psychological barrier of patients&#x2019; unfamiliarity and improved the acceptance of this model. Despite our patient population, most respondents preferred videoconferencing over telephone visits even though the former required a smartphone or a personal computer and required additional steps to connect. This observation adds to the known benefit of video conferencing as it has been shown to provide greater diagnostic accuracy and fewer medication errors compared with the telephone-only model.

          <sup>
            <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
          </sup> Although the staging of pelvic organ prolapse requires a pelvic examination, this study shows that we could provide an overview of treatment options for pelvic organ prolapse based on the patient&#x2019;s history alone. Within the field of FPMRS, the patient&#x2019;s ultimate treatment is based on shared decision-making and tailoring treatment to meet the patient&#x2019;s goals and expectations. Although we acknowledge the additional barrier of finding a private location, telemedicine visits allowed discussion of treatment options and gave patients more time to review these options before returning to the office for an examination. Future studies are needed to investigate patients&#x2019; satisfaction with treatment and telemedicine care.
        </p>
        <p>Despite many favorable findings, telemedicine&#x2019;s permanent utilization relies on either continuing pandemic-driven restrictions or the institutionalization of telemedicine-friendly policies. As such, it is pertinent to continue building further evidence with high-quality comparative studies that will support telemedicine use as an effective, efficient, and patient-centered model. In conjunction with this, standardization of telemedicine delivery policies should be carefully studied and developed to avoid any potential barriers to care and reduce health care disparity. Furthermore, establishing a validated method of educating the next generations of health care providers in best practices for telemedicine is essential to ensure that we continue to provide high-quality care across all modalities moving forward.</p>

          </sup> this study evaluated patients&#x2019; perceptions of telehealth for a broad range of diagnoses commonly seen within a urogynecology office. However, our findings should be discussed along with several significant limitations. First, the inherent selection bias present within the survey study design should be recognized because the survey was only sent to the pool of patients whose alternative to telemedicine was to delay care until in-person visits became available. This study may have overestimated the willingness to participate because the patients unwilling to accept or who did not accept a virtual visit with us may be marginalized and lack the necessary resources to participate in telemedicine care. In addition, the study was in a metropolitan city in the New England area serving mostly a privately insured White patient population, which limited the generalizability to a more diverse U.S. population. Future studies should investigate whether the willingness to participate in telemedicine is as prevalent among those who are not proficient in English. Finally, survey analysis did not include longitudinal measures to see if participants&#x2019; perceptions changed as social distancing orders continued or lifted restrictions. Telemedicine care was a novel approach to our practice with a brief time between its introduction and implementation. As such, participants&#x2019; perceptions may have been affected as the new practice model&#x2019;s efficiency evolved over time.
        </p>
        <p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated the acceptability of a telemedicine model within FPMRS. Regardless of the patient type, telemedicine modality, or visit diagnoses, telemedicine was well perceived. This study builds enthusiasm to develop further the research and clinical use of telemedicine for women with pelvic floor disorders.</p>

          <p>Background: This study set out to explore the regulatory relationship between LINC00961/miR-3127 axis and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), so as to provide a new and effective molecular target for targeted therapy of NSCLC. Methods: RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data of NSCLC and normal samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for analyzing LINC00961 and miR-3127 expression. Eighty-six pairs of clinical NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues as well as NSCLC cell lines were obtained. Measurements of LINK00961 and miR-3127 levels were done using real-time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Furthermore, LINK00961 and miR-3127 in NSCLC cell were regulated respectively. The NSCLC cell proliferation, invasion and migration were determined with MTT assay, Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. The levels of invasion- and apoptosis-related proteins were detected using western blots, and the connection of LINC00961 and miR-3127 was identified using dual luciferase reporter (DLR) assay. Results: Differential analysis results of TCGA databases identified that LINC00961 was ubiquitously expressed at low levels in NSCLC, while miR-3127 was highly expressed. Similar expression trends of LINC00961 and miR-3127 were observed in clinical NSCLC samples and cell lines. Overexpression of LINC00961 and knockdown of miR-3127 significantly reduced NCI-H1299 cell migration, invasiveness, and multiplication, decreased MMP-2, MMP-9 and Bcl-2 protein levels, and increased E-cadherin, Bax and Caspase-3 protein levels. The DLR assay confirmed that miR-3127 can be targeted by LINC00961. Conclusion: LINC00961 functions as an anti-oncogene in NSCLC by modulating miR-3127.</p>
