				<![CDATA[<p>In many parts of the US, things are returning to normal thanks to the steep drop in coronavirus cases, which in itself is very likely due to a combination of vaccination and warmer outdoor weather. I very much hope that we can continue this process on into the fall under the threat of new variant strains, and I know that I (and many others) will be watching the statistics very closely as we get into October and November!</p><p>But there&#8217;s one little local area that is not returning to normal as quickly as I would like: the comments section of this blog. For many years now, I&#8217;ve enjoyed the generally high signal/noise ratio here. The topics that come up generally inspire either informed comment or honest curiosity, and the level of discussion has been good, especially by the standards of internet comment forums. I have lost count of the number of times people have asked me how I kept things that way, and the (honest) answer was that it was pretty self-maintaining. Not too many people come in blazing with <em>ad hominem</em> attacks about someone else&#8217;s opinions on mass spectrometry, cellular counterscreening assays, or the other sorts of things that have made up the bulk of the postings here.</p><p>The pandemic changed that. The readership here increased, but that&#8217;s not the main problem by itself. I&#8217;m sure that many people will drift off &#8211; or already have started drifting off &#8211; as this site stops becoming a daily stop for coronavirus news and commentary. Some will stay around, and I&#8217;m happy to have them. But &#8211; and you know where this is going &#8211; there have also been several commentators here who have for some time been abusing this site&#8217;s hospitality. I have mentioned to these people that they don&#8217;t have to be here, that starting constant wrangling arguments about vaccines, pandemic statistics, etc. in the comments section does not have to be a regular feature of their day. No one&#8217;s taken the hint. I&#8217;ve also been hoping that these folks would just go away on their own, as fewer and fewer coronavirus posts get written, but that&#8217;s not happening very smoothly, either. I will still be writing about the pandemic from time to time, naturally, which sets things off again. And even the posts that aren&#8217;t on that topic tend to get their comments sections diverted all too quickly.</p><p>So after much thought, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to happen. Longtime readers will know that I have kept a very light hand on the comments here over the years, but starting <em>today</em> I will be deleting whatever I feel are tendentious comments meant to keep the coronavirus arguments going. I&#8217;ve actually canned a good number of comments over the last few months that are full of outright misinformation, and I&#8217;m going to lower my cutoff for that stuff, too. Complaints about censorship, freedom of expression, and so on will be allowed to stay up on this post, but only this one. I&#8217;ll be deleting those as well if they show up in the comments to other posts, and after an interval the comments to this post will be closed as well. Update: my job will be easier if people refrain from responding to obvious troll comments before I can get to them.</p><p>To the people who have been abusing the system: you are of course free to have your own opinions, and you are free to express them on your own site or anywhere else that will have you, but this is a warning notice. Do what you like but don&#8217;t do it here. You are free to contribute your thoughts on other topics if you honestly have something to add or some question to ask, but any sign of attempted pandemic flaming will be deleted as quickly as I see it. Go away and tell everyone that Big Pharma muzzled you, if that makes you feel better. But in the end, you&#8217;re already going to be the last people standing after the vaccines wipe the rest of us out, right? Isn&#8217;t that enough?</p><p>I don&#8217;t like this solution much. It&#8217;s going to be a burden on my time for a while , but I don&#8217;t like it on principle, either. Even so, I think it&#8217;s worth it to try to wrench this site back to something like what it used to be, before people showed up starting pointless arguments about pandemic statistics and vaccine issues all night long, every damn night of the week. And if the only way to do that is by force, well. . .nothing else has worked. Here goes.</p>The post <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/28/an-announcement-about-the-comment-section">An Announcement About the Comment Section</a> first appeared on <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline">In the Pipeline</a>.]]>

				<![CDATA[<p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/06/22/science.abi4708">Here&#8217;s a new paper</a> (open access) from a large multi-center team of authors urging caution on many of the reports of small-molecule repurposing screens against coronavirus activity. The list of drugs that has shown activity <em>in vitro</em> is long, and the list of potential targets is as well. But when you look at those targets, it&#8217;s hard to untangle things &#8211; for example, many compounds that are nanomolar ligands at sigma receptors have shown activity, but other nanomolar ligands are inactive. (To be sure, there are an awful lot of sigma receptor ligands out there, and if that had turned out to be an antiviral target, it would be the first solid use for sigma that I could recall). The same situation holds for the other proposed targets; there&#8217;s a lot of conflicting and contradictory evidence.</p><p>The new paper makes a strong case that there is an underlying mechanism, though: membrane disruption through phospholipidosis. Small molecules that have a charged cationic group and another region that&#8217;s very lipophilic tend to cause this problem at higher concentrations. Such molecules <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/hsz-2019-0270/html">seem to disrupt</a> lipid degradation and recycling when they accumulate in cellular compartments like endosomes and lysosomes, and the effects can be seen in those structures and other cell membranes as excess phospholipids accumulate.</p><p>As the authors point out, these pathways are also essential for viral infection, so this sort of trouble would show up as an antiviral effect in cell assays. The coronavirus (and many others) depends on hijacking membrane handling inside the cell in order to replicate, so affecting phospholipid pathways can throw that off. But it&#8217;s not something that you can translated to a real therapeutic effect, of course. For one thing, you need high concentrations of the drugs. These can be reached in cell assays, but it&#8217;s not as easy to do that <em>in vivo</em>. And more importantly, phospholipidosis is a bad thing in itself, and is not the sort of effect you want to enlist to fight off viral infections. This is something that everyone is going to have to keep in mind for the future:</p><blockquote><p><em>This apparently general mechanism may be responsible for many of the drug repurposing hits for SARS-CoV-2, and an extraordinary amount of effort and resources lavished on drug discovery against this disease. We explore the prevalence of this confound in SARS-CoV-2 repurposing studies, how phospholipidosis correlates with inhibition of viral infection, and how to eliminate such hits rapidly so as to focus on drugs with genuine potential against COVID-19, and against new pandemics yet to arise.</em></p></blockquote><p>The paper shows a strong correlation between the induction of phospholipidosis and <em>in vitro</em> antiviral activity across a large set of compounds. It&#8217;s interesting to note that the list of molecules that induce this effect includes hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and the paper hypothesizes that this is indeed  the source of their activity in cellular assays of viral infection. But the most potent compounds still could not translate to<em> in vivo</em> efficacy in rodent models, likely for just the reason mentioned above. It&#8217;s an artifact, a false positive, and people should be aware of it and stop chasing it. It&#8217;s costing us:</p><blockquote><p><em>The cost to the community of investments in what appears to be a confound merits consideration for future pandemics. According to the DrugBank COVID-19 dashboard (<a id="xref-ref-49-1" class="xref-bibr" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/06/22/science.abi4708#ref-49">49</a>), which draws from U.S. and international clinical trials, putatively antiviral CADs have been promoted into an astonishing 316 Phase I to Phase III clinical trials against COVID-19. While 57% of these study the phospholipidosis-inducing CADs hydroxychloroquine (<a id="xref-fig-3-6" class="xref-fig" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/06/22/science.abi4708#F3">Fig. 3A</a>, top row) or chloroquine, that still leaves 136 trials across 33 other predicted or known phospholipidosis-inducers. Using conservative estimates (<a id="xref-ref-50-1" class="xref-bibr" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/06/22/science.abi4708#ref-50">50</a>, <a id="xref-ref-51-1" class="xref-bibr" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/06/22/science.abi4708#ref-51">51</a>), the expense of the clinical trials component alone, over the last year, for phospholipidosis-inducing CADs may be over $6 billion US dollars (table S9).</em></p></blockquote><p>That could have been put to better use, clearly. One of the things that I very much hope that we get out of this pandemic experience is the realization that our biomedical research infrastructure was in many ways not ready for this and did not always react well. The vaccine development story has been a very positive one, fortunately, but if we run into a pathogen that is harder to vaccinate against &#8211; and there are plenty of them &#8211; then we will be thrown back on small-molecule approaches, among others. In which case we had better not spend billions of dollars on scores of useless clinical trials with molecules that have no chance of actually working.

				<![CDATA[<p>It should be obvious, given previous posts here, that I think that the FDA approval of Biogen&#8217;s aducanumab for Alzheimer&#8217;s was a mistake. It is a mistake for a whole list of reasons, and we&#8217;re about to see another one of those in action.</p><p>Eli Lilly has been attacking Alzheimer&#8217;s for decades now, in what can be seen simultaneously as admirable persistence and as a very expensive <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/06/12/an-alzheimers-statement">exercise in futility</a>. Several years ago, the company spent a great deal of time and money <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/11/23/eli-lillys-alzheimers-antibody-does-not-work">trying to prove efficacy</a> with an anti-amyloid antibody, solanezumab, and eventually got nowhere. But that was in the distant, far-off days of 2016. Things are different now: Biogen&#8217;s anti-amyloid antibody doesn&#8217;t really seem to work, either (which is why they stopped the Phase III for futility), but the FDA approved it anyway, because it lowers amyloid, even though no amyloid-lowering therapy has ever shown efficacy.</p><p>Lilly, experienced brick-wall-impacters that they are, has been working on yet another anti-amyloid antibody (donanemab). <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2100708">Phase II results came out</a> on this one in March, and it was really more of the same. There was a new rating scale endpoint, the iARDS, in which the therapy did show a statistically significant improvement at the 76-week mark. But a whole list of other endpoints whiffed, coming out no different than placebo. It was hard to generate much enthusiasm &#8211; you&#8217;d think that any Alzheimer&#8217;s therapy that actually worked, that actually had a chance of making a difference out in the real world, would be able to show more than that.</p><p>You see where we&#8217;re going here. Back in the solanezumab days (which I never thought I&#8217;d end up nostalgic for) the company would be trying to come up with another trial to show efficacy. But the heck with that. They&#8217;ve instead asked the FDA for &#8220;breakthrough&#8221; designation to try to speed regulatory approval, and the agency <a href="https://endpts.com/what-controversy-fda-throws-its-weight-behind-amyloid-theory-again-with-breakthrough-designation-for-biogens-other-alzheimers-drug/">has granted it</a>. After the aducanumab approval, what choice did they really have? For that matter, Biogen and Eisai applied for breakthrough status for their follow-up antibody, lecanemab, and the agency <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eisai-and-biogen-inc-announce-us-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-lecanemab-ban2401-an-anti-amyloid-beta-protofibril-antibody-for-the-treatment-of-alzheimers-disease-301318796.html">granted that</a> yesterday. Why not?</p><p><em>Biocentury</em>&#8216;s Steve Usdin <a href="https://www.biocentury.com/article/637248/acting-fda-commissioner-woodcock-defends-aducanumab-approval">had an interview</a> with the FDA&#8217;s Janet Woodcock <a href="https://www.biocentury.com/article/637271/fda-s-woodcock-reflects-on-aducanumab-drug-approval-standards-the-future-of-clinical-trials">recently</a>, and she has vigorously defended this approval (as she defended the <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/05/19/im-surprised-that-theyre-surprised">eteplirsen approval</a> for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which was another drug that showed <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/20/sarepta-gets-an-approval-unfortunately">no real evidence</a> of efficacy and whose approval was accomplished by her over-ruling the rest of the agency). The follow-up compound to that one was <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/22/opening-the-lid-on-sareptas-drug-approvals">suddenly approved</a> last year as well, despite no convincing efficacy data, I should add, and despite the company not having (at the time) gotten around to doing any of the post-approval studies that they committed to with eteplirsen, either. We&#8217;ll see how Biogen does with its post-approval study of aducanumab in Alzheimer&#8217;s patients, which was also mandated by the FDA. They have nine years to do it, and my prediction, unfortunately, is that they will take <em>every single day</em> of it.</p><p>At any rate, the Woodcock interview is very interesting, but often odd. For example, there&#8217;s this statement:</p><div class="page" title="Page 2"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;. . .What we&#8217;re seeing now is this blend of empiricism and extremely advanced mechanism-based drug development. It&#8217;s hard for everybody to adapt. It’s like “What party are we at today?”</em></p><p><em>In some areas we&#8217;re seeing very close working together to chart the path forward and extremely mechanistically based interventions. At the same time, we&#8217;re still seeing standard drug development. You don&#8217;t hear too many people talking about high-throughput screening anymore, though, for example, which is the height of empiricism.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>I think she&#8217;s confusing HTS with phenotypic screening there. A lot of target-driven mechanism-based drug discovery efforts start with high-throughput screens against those targets, while a target-agnostic phenotypic approach is what I would call the &#8220;height of empiricism&#8221;. But if that&#8217;s what she meant, it&#8217;s odd to say that you don&#8217;t hear many people talking about it any more.</p><p>Woodcock points out in the interview that she herself was not involved in the aducanumab decision. In response to a direct question on the matter, I would call this a sidestep:</p><div class="page" title="Page 4"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><blockquote><p><em><strong>Biocentury</strong>: . . .Where people are questioning it is whether there&#8217;s a connection between that and clinical benefit. Are we going to see FDA’s thinking about that, about why you&#8217;re confident that it&#8217;s reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit?</em></p><p><em><strong>Woodcock</strong>: Yes, that&#8217;s definitely part of an accelerated approval, of course, because there’s long been skepticism about the amyloid hypothesis. I think they are acutely aware of that.</em></p></blockquote><p>She also said that the approval was &#8220;<em>was based on much more solid data than many of the other approvals that we do for serious and life-threatening diseases like cancer</em>&#8220;, but to me that evades the question as well. These cancer trials do not take place against a backdrop of repeated failures against the exact same hypothesis, do they? That, and the relatively quick and fatal course of the underlying disease, is what makes accelerated approval in that area more appropriate (and more feasible, in my eyes), and I just can&#8217;t make the same case for yet another whack at the amyloid hypothesis in Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p><p>These antibodies (and who knows what else) will be up for approval well before the Biogen post-approval data are ready. And even if aducanumab doesn&#8217;t turn out to work, how much difference will the FDA then allow that to make? That one didn&#8217;t do much, but maybe the next amyloid-clearing agent will? How will you know unless you approve it and find out? Oh, I know, you could make the companies run those trials, but desperate patients are waiting, money in hand, and you wouldn&#8217;t want to deny them (and their insurance companies) a chance to spend it on something that you&#8217;re not sure does any good. Right?</p><p>So if you look at the disease landscape not knowing the back story, things look great: the FDA just approved a new Alzheimer&#8217;s drug and now there are two more Breakthroughs right behind it! But if you do know what&#8217;s going on, it&#8217;s downright depressing: the agency approved a drug that shows no solid evidence of helping anyone (and more believable evidence of its ability to cause harm), and this mistake is allowing everyone else to jump on the same damn bandwagon with data that are no better. Put out more flags.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>The post <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/24/open-the-floodgates">Open the Floodgates</a> first appeared on <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline">In the Pipeline</a>.]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, organic chemist Ei-ichi Negishi died at the age of 85. I missed this event (I wasn&#8217;t posting during those few days) so I wanted to note it here, because Negishi was a huge name in the field. There&#8217;s <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/10/06/a_nobel_for_palladium_couplings_at_last">a Nobel prize</a> to back that statement up (Chemistry, 2010), and plenty of other awards as well. But <em>si monumentum requiris, circumspice</em>: the sorts of metal-catalyzed couplings that he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negishi_coupling">spent his career</a> working on have become indispensable tools in organic synthesis, and the field is still an active area of research. Carbon-carbon bond formation is a high-denomination coin in organic chemistry, as are high-turnover catalytic methods, so the amount of interest (both academic and industrial) in these reactions is not surprising. The number of compounds that have been made by now through these routes is just not feasible to even start counting.</p><p>As his <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/chemistry-nobel-laureate-ei-ichi-negishi-dies-at-85/4013843.article"><em>Chemistry World</em> obituary</a> notes, Negishi actually left a press conference about his Nobel award to go teach a sophomore organic class, and I don&#8217;t think anyone who knew him well would be surprised to hear it. He had a legendary work ethic (retiring from Purdue, where he spent nearly all his career, only two years ago). Interestingly, he had been a postdoc with H. C. Brown, who later was Purdue&#8217;s first Nobel winner. That work ethic extended to his lab &#8211; stories I&#8217;ve heard over the years made clear that Negishi expected people to be at the bench solving problems, and his field of research gave them plenty of opportunities. At the same time, he also had a reputation for approachability, for students of all levels, and shared his expertise freely at all times.</p><p>The metal-catalyzed coupling reactions have been developed to the point where it&#8217;s hard (read: impossible) to keep track of all the possible reactions, conditions, and substrates. There are a lot of variables that can be explored, and the detailed mechanisms of the reactions can change on your depending on the metal used and many other factors besides. But when optimized, they can be run on very large scale in a reproducible way. My own graduate training in the 1980s took place when this sort of thing was just starting to come into better focus, and it really did seem like having some sort of magic powers to be able to form all these compounds through stitching together actual carbon-carbon bonds. Organic chemistry students now come up in a world where these things are facts of life, but that Nobel (which also went to Richard Heck and Akira Suzuki) was well-deserved and frankly, well overdue. One of things that might have delayed it was the 3-awardee-maximum requirement; there were many others who had made serious contributions to the area, because it was such a huge field to work in.</p><p>No Nobel since has been awarded for new synthetic organic methods. We&#8217;ll see another one eventually, but by the time it happens none of the living Nobel winners in that field may still be with us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>The post <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/23/ei-ichi-negishi-1935-2021">Ei-ichi Negishi, 1935-2021</a> first appeared on <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline">In the Pipeline</a>.]]>

				<![CDATA[<p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.1c00389">This paper</a> (open access) is not going to be to everyone&#8217;s taste, but the people who are working <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ablogs.sciencemag.org+protein+degradation">in its area</a> &#8211; and there&#8217;s an ever-increasing number of them &#8211; will want to read it closely. It&#8217;s a close look at the red-hot fields of targeted protein degradation and &#8220;molecular glues&#8221;, and for those who aren&#8217;t into those, the next paragraphs will give you some background. If you&#8217;re already into degradation &#8211; that didn&#8217;t quite come out right &#8211; skip ahead if you like:</p><p><em>So the idea behind targeted protein degradation (and now many related ideas besides) is the creation of a &#8220;bifunctional&#8221; molecule to hijack an existing cellular pathway. For TPD, you&#8217;re latching onto the protein ubiquitination system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin">Ubiquitin</a> is a short protein tag that&#8217;s appended to lysine residues of other proteins, yet another post-translational modification, and Ub resides can be &#8220;stacked&#8221; onto each other into various sorts of oligomeric chains. If the right ones get added in the right quantity, it&#8217;s a signal that the protein thus tagged is ready for the cellular scrap heap, like a fluorescent orange waste disposal sticker. These Ub tags are applied by a set of enzymes (there&#8217;s a whole collection of them in cells) that are specialized for just that purpose.</em></p><p><em>Polyubiquitinated proteins are taken up by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome">proteasome</a>, which as I&#8217;m fond of saying is a tubular structure resembling the planet-destroyer thingie in the old Star Trek episode &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doomsday_Machine_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)">The Doomsday Machine</a>&#8220;. Proteins enter one end of the proteasome and are ripped to shreds by a wall of protease enzymes facing the inside, and recycled amino acid rubble comes out the other end. So what if you could target specific proteins for this fate before their time?</em></p><p><em>That&#8217;s the plan. What you do is find a molecule that binds to some component of that ubiquitinating machinery (usually the part called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin_ligase">E3 ligase</a>). There are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2472555220965528">many of these</a> known, targeting different ligases, with (weirdly enough) the infamous thalidomide as one of the first to be proven for a particular E3. Then you find a molecule that binds your target protein &#8211; it can be an inhibitor, an allosteric site binder, whatever, just so long as it binds well. Now the so-obvious-it&#8217;s-dumb part: you take both of those molecules and build a linker between them to turn them into One Big Odd-Looking Molecule. One end of your new beast will grab onto the target protein, and the other end will grab onto the ubiquitination complex, and you will thus bring them into a close proximity that otherwise they would surely not otherwise enjoy.</em></p><p><em>The crazy thing is, it works: we have many examples now of such bifunctional degraders that manage to get into cells and cause drastic, sudden reductions in the amount of their targeted proteins as they get dragged, no doubt kicking and protesting, off to the proteasome shredder. What&#8217;s more, the bifunctional molecule survives the experience and goes back to degrade again, so you get true catalytic cycles out of the things. These have been shown to work in animal models, and several have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-021-00052-4">now been dosed</a> in human clinical trials &#8211; it&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761331/">whole new way</a> to attack targets of disease that we&#8217;ve never had before. We can block up active sites of proteins, but that leaves many of their other functions with other binding partners undisturbed. We can genetically silence expression of proteins, but that gives the cells time to come up with emergency backup plans in many cases. But reaching in during the middle of the cellular business day and zapping targeted proteins out of existence &#8211; that&#8217;s something new!</em></p><p><em>The idea doesn&#8217;t stop there. You can potentially bring *any* two proteins together if you have molecules targeting each partner. So you could haul a kinase over and have it phosphorylate the other, or a phosphatase to have it take any nearby phosphates off (this stuff has been <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01167?ref=pdf">demonstrated</a>), and once you start thinking in that direction a whole <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/education/students/college/social-distancing-socials/acs-jmedchem-bifuntional-molecules.pdf">list of ideas</a> will occur to you. It&#8217;s not a small field now, but it&#8217;s going to get a *lot* bigger.</em></p><p><em>Molecular glues are another bizarre thing, with some similarities and some differences. In this case, you&#8217;re bringing two proteins together with a single small molecule &#8211; and some of them really are small &#8211; that binds to both of them simultaneously and may even arrange the two protein surfaces into a more favorable shape. I would not have thought that this was likely, or even possible, if you&#8217;d tried to sell me on it twenty years ago. But that&#8217;s what thalidomide itself does (when it&#8217;s by itself), <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm3842">and it&#8217;s also</a> what how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxin">auxin</a> plant hormones work. I would have told you that this would be like trying to stick two cruise ships together by jamming a sailboat in between them, but proteins are a lot more complicated and interesting than your average cruise ship. People are currently searching all over the place for more of these things and trying to understand when they can work and how.</em></p><p>OK, then. By now there are a lot of examples of bifunctionals and several molecular glues, but the field has been, well, extremely empirical. Take those linkers that you have to build into make the bifunctionals. How long should they be, and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00482?ref=recommended">what should they look like</a>? Alkane chains, polyethylene glycol-like stuff, amides, sulfonamides, triazoles made via click chemistry? There are a lot of ways to do that, and they vary greatly in polarity, molecular weight, conformational flexibility, and more. People have tried all kinds of variations, and what we know for sure is that different linkers vary widely in their effectiveness once you&#8217;ve settled into a given system. But there are very few useful systematic rules; often enough you just make things and keep making them until something works, and when it works you&#8217;re not quite sure why.</p><p>The tricky part is that a ternary complex has to form for all these ideas to work, and that takes you into <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650257/">pretty complex</a> kinetic and thermodynamic territory. As you can picture, there are a lot of possibilities about what binds to what and in what order, and plenty of rate constants that can kick the outcomes all over the place. This new paper tackles these in a comprehensive way. One key, as it details, is to separate the ideas of cooperativity and binary affinity. Many bifunctionals have very high binary affinity (each end binds strongly to its partner) but are nothing special in cooperativity. And many molecular glues are at the other end of the spectrum: the glue molecule has terrible binding (one-on-one) to Protein A, and terrible binding to Protein B, but bring all three of them together and you get a nice tight complex. Counterintuitive, to say the least, but this &#8220;induced cooperativity&#8221; is what makes the whole thing work, as the protein structures shift around. And it&#8217;s what makes screening for these things rather labor-intensive, and it also shows you how my cruise ship analogy breaks down, because they aren&#8217;t quite so flexible.</p><p>If you overdo the binary affinity part (through very tight interactions or high concentrations), bifunctionals suffer from what&#8217;s been called a &#8220;<a href="https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.15014">hook effect</a>&#8221; &#8211; the binary interactions get so favorable that the ternary complex doesn&#8217;t form properly, which is truly not what you want. Any consideration of thermodynamics will of course break down into entropy and enthalpy, and there&#8217;s plenty of that to go around here. The enthalpy terms (energies of the actual binding interactions) can be cancelled out by the entropic penalties of assembling a more ordered ternary complex, particularly one that involves flexible parts that might have suddenly had to get a lot less flexible. And there are all sorts of potential ternary complexes, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-00686-2">some of which</a> are more productive than others.</p><p>The middle of the paper goes into detail on all this, and the latter part talks about cellular context. Which frankly, is even more of a black box. You get into all sorts of fuzzy discussions about the &#8220;tone&#8221; of the various systems (how much capacity they have, how much range, how much disruption of them might be needed to achieve the desired effects, and so on). The best way forward here seems to be the development of better high-throughput cellular assays, although no one&#8217;s going to turn up their nose at any new fundamental insights, either.</p><p>So if you&#8217;re a degrader/glue type, have a look. You&#8217;ll run into some things you already knew, but you&#8217;ll find others that you hadn&#8217;t devoted enough thought to, as well. Very few of us have devoted enough!</p>The post <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/22/hard-thinking-about-protein-degradation-and-bifunctional-molecules">Hard Thinking About Protein Degradation and Bifunctional Molecules</a> first appeared on <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline">In the Pipeline</a>.]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s some interesting work from Dana-Farber (earlier BioRxiv version <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.111658v1.full">here</a>) that may turn into a rare example of repurposing an old drug, if it works out. The team was studying an enzyme called DNA polymerase theta (also known by its corresponding gene name, POLQ), which is one of the lesser-known members of that functional family. Some of these seem to be involved in DNA replication <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8069355/">under high-stress</a> conditions, and polymerase theta seems to be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4415602/">required</a> when there is a deficiency in homologous recombination (HR) mechanisms in a cell (involved in the repair of double-strand breaks). Loss of both of those pathways leads to &#8220;synthetic lethality&#8221;, that is, a lethal effect from a combination of gene or protein knockdowns when neither of the individual targets are lethal by themselves.</p><p>There are tumor types that have that HR deficiency already operating, so there&#8217;s been a lot of interest in completing the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33716297/">synthetic lethality combo</a> for those. One big push has been into PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase) inhibitors, <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/03/15/parp-inhibitors-do-it-again">several of which</a> have reached the clinic and the market, but (as with most any oncology mechanism), PARP inhibitor resistance also develops. So you&#8217;d want another way to attack this mechanism, and polymerase theta has been the subject of a lot of interest.</p><p>In this case, the team found by screening that a longtime antibiotic molecule, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novobiocin">novobiocin</a>, turns out to be a good polymerase theta inhibitor. It&#8217;s long been known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_gyrase#Inhibition_by_antibiotics">DNA gyrase inhibitor</a> in bacteria, although not a clinically useful one, where it works by hitting an ATP-binding site. I spent some time messing around with it and some derivatives in my own antibiotic days. More recently, it&#8217;s been shown to hit other such sites, such as on <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja065793p">human HSP90</a>. And that&#8217;s what seems to be going on here: it seems to be working deep into an ATP pocket on the polymerase. There&#8217;s an impressive amount of cellular and <em>in vivo</em> validation in the paper, showing that novobiocin does indeed have significant effects on HR-deficient tumor lines (but not those that still have that pathway intact), that it potentiates the effects of PARP inhibitors in such tumors, and that indeed it can overcome PARP resistance once that has set in, at least through several of its known mechanisms. This may or may not bring novobiocin itself back as a drug &#8211; although it&#8217;s definitely something to look into &#8211; but it really shores up the whole idea of polymerase-theta inhibitors as drug candidates in general.</p><p>Novobiocin itself <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/01/19/2011-1000/determination-that-albamycin-novobiocin-sodium-capsule-250-milligrams-was-withdrawn-from-sale-for">was withdrawn</a> from the US market back in the 1980s, due to an unfavorable efficacy/safety profile. But that was in the context of other effective antibiotics &#8211; oncology is another matter. You would imagine that you&#8217;d want to treat patients with HR-deficient tumors with a dual regimen of PARP and polymerase-theta inhibitors, in order to give the cells fewer ways to escape. This paper demonstrates that the two pathways do seem to be independent, making it an obvious cocktail combination, and polymerase theta expression (the authors show) may well be a prospective marker for selecting the patients you&#8217;d want to treat.</p><p>Interestingly, novobiocin was <a href="https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/51/2/510?ijkey=2adc99a637c05cf478266905b64ac4598b006005&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha">actually the subject</a> of an oncology trial in the early 1990s, since it had been shown to potentiate the effects of DNA-damaging agents in animal studies. Some of the patients in this Phase I showed responses, although the patients were in no way selected for HR-deficient tumor types, so a trial in those patients would seem to be a straightforward thing to mount, and I hope we see one underway soon.</p><p>There are other polymerase-theta inhibitors being investigated &#8211; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23463-8">here&#8217;s a paper</a> that just came out with an allosteric inhibitor &#8211; but I don&#8217;t see how any of those will reach the clinic more quickly than novobiocin. And there&#8217;s a lot of clinical work to be done. Working out the combinations with various PARP inhibitors (with and without other DNA-targeting therapies) and figuring out patient selection will all need work, and novobiocin might be the tool to do it.</p>The post <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/21/novobiocin-returns-but-not-as-an-antibiotic">Novobiocin Returns?

				<![CDATA[<p>I wasn&#8217;t planning on having this turn into Coronavirus Vaccine Week again around here, but we do have some news. Yesterday afternoon CureVac, the German mRNA vaccine company, <a href="https://www.curevac.com/en/2021/06/16/curevac-provides-update-on-phase-2b-3-trial-of-first-generation-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-cvncov/">reported results</a> of their Phase III trial in 40,000 patients around the world. They weren&#8217;t good. And the data that have come out today don&#8217;t make things look any better.</p><p>The figure that came out last night was 47% efficacy, which doesn&#8217;t reach anyone&#8217;s cutoff for approval, not even for emergency use. And the slides that have been released this morning show that there are still a number of cases that are being evaluated, so that number is very likely to go down. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/MedResCol/status/1405495518357299202?s=20">one tweet</a> speculating that the final number might be as low as 40%. At any rate, the big question is why this mRNA candidate is so much worse than the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech ones.</p><p>Actually, the first question on that topic is whether it is worse in the first place. CureVac has spent a lot of time in its public statements talking about the variants that its trial ran into and saying that these are the reason for the lower efficacy. Implicit in that is the idea that if you ran the other two mRNA vaccines in a trial right now, you&#8217;d come out with similar numbers. But I have trouble believing that. The real-world protection that we&#8217;re seeing in mRNA-vaccinated populations simply does not reflect an underlying efficacy in the 40% range. That&#8217;s the biggest argument right there.</p><p>We also have a lot of evidence that blood serum from vaccinated patients can indeed neutralize the newer variants of the coronavirus &#8211; here&#8217;s one of those papers <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00755-8">that just came out</a>, and there are many others. The neutralization is lower, to be sure, but still well above the range that should be protective. (And remember, that&#8217;s just the antibody side of the story &#8211; the T-cell side of things <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(21)00279-1">looks robust</a> as well, although it&#8217;s harder to study). So there is evidence both in the lab and out in the streets that the existing mRNA vaccines are (so far) able to continue performing in the face of the variants. I cannot accept the hypothesis that the CureVac vaccine is functionally identical to the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech ones, not on the data we have now.</p><p>So if it really is inferior, then why? What are the differences between this one and the other two mRNA agents? The biggest one that I can see is that the CureVac vaccine does not use any modified mRNA bases &#8211; in fact, they have <a href="https://www.curevac.com/en/covid-19/">pointed to this</a> as a feature, in the hopes that this will induce a more wide-ranging immune response. Meanwhile, the other two have made extensive use of bases like N-methylpseudouridine, in an effort to improve stability. So one possibility &#8211; a pretty likely one, in my view &#8211; is that the all-natural RNA idea has turned out to be a mistake, and that the CureVac agent is getting broken down too quickly to be effective, both inside and outside cells.</p><p>There&#8217;s also the possibility that the lipid nanoparticle formulation they&#8217;re using is in some way less effective than the ones used by the other companies. I find this less likely. For one thing, both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines seem to work very well, despite being different lipid mixtures, which at least says that there not One Single Formulation that works. Second, CureVac has, as I understand it, been working with Acuitas for this part of their vaccine, the same company that has been involved with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. So they would have brought their own considerable expertise to bear, you would have to think.</p><p>For now, then, I think the most likely possibility is that CureVac&#8217;s vaccine is indeed notably less effective than its competitors, and that this is due to its unmodified RNA composition. The result of all this is particularly unfortunate, since the EU and others had been counting on this one to deliver. That brings up another point that has to be emphasized again: <em>we have been extremely fortunate</em>.</p><p>It should be obvious by now, given the number of prominent failures, that generating an effective coronavirus vaccine is not something you can just stroll up to. As we&#8217;ve found, it&#8217;s definitely not impossible &#8211; and remember, there were plenty of doomsayers last year who were trying to tell everyone that it was, and that we&#8217;d never be able to get a vaccine at all. But it&#8217;s no sure thing, either, far from it. Ask Merck, ask GSK, ask Sanofi, ask Queensland, ask plenty of other players who have dropped out, and now ask CureVac. This also points up the crucial nature of taking all those shots on goal. There are a lot of factors that are literally beyond our control when such therapies get into clinical trials, and there are other things that we have to learn the hard way so that we can control for them the next time around. The fact that we have any vaccines at all is worth celebrating, and the fact that we have some that work so well, and with such good safety records, is a world-historical stroke of good news.</p>The post <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/17/curevac-comes-up-short">CureVac Comes Up Short</a> first appeared on <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline">In the Pipeline</a>.]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acschembio.1c00036">this paper</a> (open access) on some problems with chemical probes, and now&#8217;s a good time. There was a <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/07/22/chemical_probe_compounds_time_to_get_real">well-known article</a> a few years ago about &#8220;The Promise and Peril of Chemical Probes&#8221;, and this is a deliberate follow-up, starting with its title. Even if you don&#8217;t give much of a hoot about chemical probes, the point it makes is worth keeping in mind.</p><p>All chemical probes have some off-target effects. Some of the things sold as such in the catalogs (and referenced in the literature, to this day) have so many of these that they&#8217;re worthless. In fact, they&#8217;re worse than worthless; they cause active confusion and harm. One way to validate your experiments with the more useful ones is to use a very closely related compound that <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> have the desired probe activity, in the hopes that it will still maintain the off-target binding activities. It would be nice if every chemical probe had a selection of these available, but that is not the world we find ourselves in.</p><p>And what this new paper says is that even some of the ones that people have been trusting are. . .not so great. For example, <a href="https://www.chemicalprobes.org/A-196">A-196</a> is a pretty well-validated probe for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV420H1">SUV420H1</a> and SUV420H2 enzymes, which are specific lysine demethylases. A similar compound, A-197, <a href="https://www.caymanchem.com/product/18317">is sold</a> as a negative control for experimental validation. But if you profile the two compounds against a wide panel of receptors, enzymes, transport proteins and so on, you find that A-196 has six off-target activities on that list, and A-197 not only loses activity against SUV420H1, but it loses activity against five of those other targets as well.</p><p>The same goes for another epigenetic probe, <a href="https://www.chemicalprobes.org/nvs-mllt-1">NVS-MLLT-1</a>. It has six off-target activities in the profile screen, but the compound that&#8217;s suggested as its negative control, NVS-MLLT-C, loses activity at five of them, too. To be sure, all of these six targets are being hit at low micromolar range or a bit below (depending on your assay technique), whereas the interaction with the probe target (interaction of histones with the the YEATS/MLLT proteins) is about tenfold more potent. But the recommendation is to use this one at 5 to 10 micromolar concentrations in cell assays, so depending on the tone of the off-target systems, you could still get misled.</p><p>Many of these negative control compounds change out a charged atom (such as a nitrogen) for something uncharged, like a straight carbon or a basic-nitrogen-to-amide switch. And the problem, which is going to be very hard to completely escape, is that these sorts of atoms are likely going to be involved in binding to those other targets as well, so you can&#8217;t get as clean a slice in the activity profile as you&#8217;d want. This paper only looks at four compounds (and their suggested controls), but tries to extend the reach computationally. The authors pulled data from the PDB on identical ligands bound to different protein sites, and then looked at the predicted effect of adding a methyl group to such a compound by systematically replacing every plausible hydrogen with a methyl.</p><p>An example of what happens is with the JAK2 inhibitor <a href="https://www.caymanchem.com/product/14696/tg101209">TG101209</a>, which also binds BRD4. There are 25 possible methylation sites, and five of these would be predicted to knock out the JAK2 binding. But four of those would <em>also</em> be predicted to knock out BRD4 binding as well. So there&#8217;s a significant risk that plausible negative control compounds around TG101209 would be less useful than you would want, whether you&#8217;re approaching this from the JAK2-binding side of the story or the BRD4-binding side. The authors extended this to 41 other such pairs, using protein binding domains that were as dissimilar as possible, and found an average 50% chance of trouble with this methyl-substitution idea. That leads one to think that there&#8217;s generally a substantial chance of a given negative control compound modification wiping out on other unrelated targets as well.</p><p>What the paper ends up recommending is developing at least two chemically distinct probes for every target, and while that is going to involve a lot of work, I think that they&#8217;re right: that&#8217;s the only way that we&#8217;re going to be (reasonably) sure that we&#8217;re looking at what we think we are. They note the example of <a href="https://www.chemicalprobes.org/lly-507">LLY507</a>, a SMYD2 inhibitor probe that kills off glioblastoma cells. But before you run out and publish a paper on the importance of SMYD2 in glioblastoma (it&#8217;s another lysine methyltransferase for histones), or worse yet try to use such an inhibitor as a drug for the disease, you might want to know that a structurally different SMYD2 inhibitor, <a href="https://www.chemicalprobes.org/bay-598">BAY-598</a>, doesn&#8217;t show that cytotoxicity at all. So a selection of probes would be rather handy, and comparison of the negative controls for both such compounds would be, too. We have enough noise in the literature already, right?</p>The post <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/16/chose-your-controls-wisely">Chose Your Controls Wisely</a> first appeared on <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline">In the Pipeline</a>.]]>

				<![CDATA[<p><strong>1. Novavax Clinical Data</strong></p><p>Word <a href="https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-90-overall-efficacy-and">came yesterday</a> that Novavax had very good safety and efficacy in the trial of their recombinant protein vaccine. This is good news. By this point, the vaccine is much less needed here in the US, but it could be a very important part of getting many other countries vaccinated, due to its less demanding storage requirements and (relatively) straightforward production process. The company does intend to file for FDA approval, and is in the last stages of getting all of its manufacturing and quality control procedures ready for that. I hope that this opens up to worldwide usage of this one, and that the company really is ready for large-scale production.</p><p>As many readers are well aware, this is a recombinant protein vaccine, not a viral vector (like J&amp;J or the Oxford/AZ vaccines), and not an mRNA one like Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech. I also hope that this allays some of the worries that many people still have about those two platforms: recombinant protein vaccines have been around for longer, so this one would (presumably) be less of a concern for some potential users.</p><p><strong>2. Circulating Spike and S1 Proteins After Vaccination</strong></p><p>Let&#8217;s talk about one of those concerns in particular. I am still getting question after question about the Spike protein being produced by the mRNA and viral-vector vaccines. Not a day goes by without someone contacting me about this issue, and recently these messages have taken on a slightly different tone. I last <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/05/04/spike-protein-behavior">wrote about this issue here</a>, and since then there have been other publications that bear on the topic. Here&#8217;s a key one: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab465/6279075">this paper</a> describes the detection of the Spike protein in the bloodstream of patients who received the Moderna vaccine. Now, in that earlier blog post I spent several paragraphs going on about how the Spike protein (because of its transmembrane anchor) would not be floating around in the bloodstream, and you can be sure that many of my correspondents have reminded me of that. But see below for more details!</p><p>To be sure, the new paper uses a very sensitive assay to find the protein &#8211; <a href="https://www.quanterix.com/simoa-technology/">Simoa</a>, which is a single-molecule detection method. I&#8217;ll explain that one briefly for those who are interested; if you&#8217;re not, you can skip ahead and just stipulate that this is pretty much the gold standard for detecting very small amounts of protein in biological samples.</p><p><strong>2a: The Assay Technology</strong></p><p><em>So, you take antibodies against your protein of interest (you do need those, just as with the older ELISA assays!) and chemically conjugate them to tiny magnetic beads. These beads have a couple of hundred thousand attachment sites on them, so you&#8217;ll be carpeting their surfaces with your antibodies. That said, you then use a large excess of the beads (maybe tenfold) when it comes time to analyze a blood or tissue sample. You&#8217;ll be using this technique to detect very small amounts of protein (up to 1000x times smaller than you can work with using ELISA) and ideally, you want the majority of the beads to not capture any sample at all, and the ones that do capture a target protein to only capture one.</em></p><p><em>A big excess of beads with a lot of capture antibodies on them means that your target protein is going to be vacuumed up out of solution really quickly, and as <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/05/13/tie-me-proteins-all-down-sport">this post explains</a>, that&#8217;s a real advantage in these methods. The more time proteins spend rubbing up against and rolling across surfaces, the more degraded and denatured they get, so speed is definitely a virtue here. Once you&#8217;ve done this, then (as with an ELISA) you set up a &#8220;sandwich&#8221; assay format, where your protein of interest <a href="https://www.quanterix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AAPS_2014_Merck_Simoa_Poster.pdf">ends up captured</a> by one antibody, while its remained exposed surface then gets bound to another detection antibody. This detection antibody has biotin tags already attached to it, and every time you see biotin stuck onto something, you know that it&#8217;s going to be used to grab onto some other reagent that has biotin&#8217;s lifelong love, streptavidin, attached to it. Indeed, once you&#8217;ve hit the sample-incubated beads with the detection antibody, you add in a streptavidin-beta-galactosidase enzyme conjugate, so that in the end, every bead that captured a target protein now has a detection antibody stuck to that in turn, which is then stuck to a streptavidin-enzyme species. A sandwich indeed!</em></p><p><em>All these beads are <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20190805/The-Scientific-Principle-of-Single-Molecule-Array-Technology.aspx">then distributed</a> into a microwell system that the company that own Simoa (Quanterix) will be happy to sell you. These microwells are ridiculously small (femtoliter-sized) and can only hold one bead at a time. You use a layer of oil to seal those into the wells, along with a supply of <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Resorufin">resorufin</a> beta-galactopyranoside. That one is a fluorescent hand grenade of a molecule: the enzyme that you conjugated to those beads that picked up a target protein is waiting to cleave that galactose sugar off, which liberates the wildly fluorescent free resorufin. And since you&#8217;ve got a lot of the stuff sealed into those tiny micron-sized wells, you build up a really bright fluorescent signal very quickly, far more bright and concentrated than you can with an ELISA assay. This confinement-and-fluorescent-buildup is a big part of how you can do single-molecule detection with this technique. You then read off the wells that are glowing compared to the ones that aren&#8217;t, and if there are plenty of the latter you&#8217;re in good shape to analyze for the real concentration of your target.</em></p><p><strong>2b: S1 and Spike Levels</strong></p><p>This paper marks the first time anyone has detected Spike or S1 protein in the bloodstream of vaccinated patients, and that can be put down to the use of this very sensitive assay. The team looked at full-length Spike, the S1 subunit (after the furin cleavage site has done its thing), nucleocapsid (N) viral protein, and antibodies against all of these as well. The assays were baselined against plasma from Covid-19-positive plasma samples from infected patients, healthy subject samples from before the pandemic, pre-pandemic samples from people with other respiratory infections, Covid-19-negative patients, and so on.</p><p>Remember, the mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines will only produce Spike protein, so measuring the coronavirus N protein is a good control (there should be none of that unless you&#8217;re infected by the actual coronavirus, since vaccination by these agents cannot make your cells produce it). And indeed, in 13 patients the authors could find S1 protein in 11 of them after the first dose of Moderna vaccine, and Spike in all of them, with no N protein anywhere. The S1 protein started showing up as early as the first day after vaccination, peaked at around day 5, and was undetectable by day 14. The mean peak value was about 68 picograms/mL, although from the figure you can see that this number is influenced by a few high outliers &#8211; most of the numbers are 50 or under. That 14-day disappearance is surely because by that time you have raised a strong antibody response to the S1 protein, and it&#8217;s being cleared &#8211; the antibody levels found in this paper bear that out exactly as you&#8217;d expect. As for the full-length Spike itself, it was seen in three of the 13 patients, but later &#8211; an average of 15 days after vaccination. After the second vaccination, no S1 protein could be detected at all.</p><p>The reason for the differences between the S1 and Spike levels is unclear, but the authors suggest a plausible hypothesis. The mRNA from the vaccine starts being picked up and translated into protein almost immediately, as is clear from the quick detection of S1 protein. That&#8217;s there because it&#8217;s been cleaved off the full Spike protein, but the reason that the Spike itself isn&#8217;t found (at least at the limits of detection in the assay, and it&#8217;s a really good assay) is because it&#8217;s bound to the cells where it&#8217;s produced, by the transmembrane anchor region (discussed in that <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/05/04/spike-protein-behavior">earlier post</a> I referenced above). The reason that no S1 protein is found after the second vaccination is clear &#8211; by then, a robust antibody response to it has had a chance to develop, and the protein gets rapidly cleared from the blood, just like it&#8217;s supposed to.</p><p>What about those instances where some full-length Spike protein shows up later? Well, consider what happens after the vaccination, when the cells that have taken up the mRNA make and present Spike protein on their surfaces. That (and the free-swimming S1 subunits that are cleaved off of these) set off a response in the adaptive immune system, which after all is the whole point of administering a vaccine. And that response (especially the now-activated T cells) leads to the infected cells being killed off (as is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689109/">observed</a> with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0264410X9500255Y?via%3Dihub">other</a> types of cell-infecting <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/3301534">vaccines</a>). At that point some intact Spike protein can get released, now that the cell membrane is being destroyed. The 15-day lag fits that timeline very well.</p><p>Mention of that process leads me to address a concern that I&#8217;ve also been asked about: if the cells affected by the vaccine are killed off by your body&#8217;s own immune system, isn&#8217;t that bad? How much muscle tissue, etc., are you losing? I have not seen an estimate &#8211; that number would be very hard to pin down! But a decent-sized muscle like the deltoid has on the order of a hundred thousand muscle fibers (each an individual large muscle cell) in it &#8211; there are around 250,000 in the bicep, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12811774/">apparently</a>. And each of these is surely getting infected by a great many mRNA particles (they are large, as mentioned, with a lot of surface area). But how many of these are attacked in the end by T cells, I don&#8217;t know. Keep in mind, though, that infection by the real coronavirus is surely far more destructive, and you will be losing plenty cells of all description if that happens to you. The vaccine does its thing without replicating, whereas a real infection can flood your body with infectious viral particles.</p><p><strong>3. Circulating Spike and S1 Proteins During Coronavirus Infection</strong></p><p>That leads us to another interesting question: what are the levels of that S1 protein seen after vaccination as compared to a real infection? This same team of authors has used the same assay technology to <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.20156372v1.full.pdf">study infected patients</a>, which makes comparison very clear-cut. The levels of circulating S1 protein are in fact quite similar, and the profile of decreasing S1 over the course of infection (as the antibody response kicks in) is seen in the same manner.</p><p>But let&#8217;s get down to what my correspondents are worried about: those animal studies where <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318902">Spike protein</a> was produced by a pseudovirus, or the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351286488_Single_intratracheal_exposure_to_SARS-CoV-2_S1_spike_protein_induces_acute_lung_injury_in_K18-hACE2_transgenic_mice">S1 subunit</a> was administered directly. Both of these caused pathology in the animals all by itself, without coronavirus itself being present. Why, I get asked constantly, would I allow my own body&#8217;s cells to make this stuff, if it&#8217;s the cause of all the trouble?</p><p>The thing is, it doesn&#8217;t appear that it <em>is</em> the main cause. If you go to that first link in this section, the one where they quantified these proteins in sick patients, it looks like S1 levels can be useful in judging severity, but only up to a point. Patients with the highest levels of S1 on admission to the hospital were more likely to end up in to the ICU more quickly, but that could also correlate with total viral load, with lack of a robust immune response, and other factors. And there was no statistically significant difference in death rate between patients with low or high S1 levels. As the paper itself notes, their patients were all admitted to the hospital, so they were already presenting with severe disease &#8211; but some of them had single-digit pg/mL concentrations, while others were at 50, 60, or higher. So you can have hospitalization-worthy severe coronavirus but still have quite low S1 concentrations.</p><p>Now, you may look at those numbers and say &#8220;<em>Hold it &#8211; those sound pretty much like the S1 levels you get in the first few days after you&#8217;re vaccinated</em>&#8220;. They are indeed. But that brings us to another line of argument. I have no patience with the anti-vaccine commentators who are talking about the vaccines mowing people down like wheat, because that is <em>obviously not happening</em>. If hitting an S1 plasma level of 68 picograms/mL was sufficient to destroy your lungs, we would have destroyed tens, hundreds of millions by now. We have not. Nothing of the sort was seen in any of the animal studies, in any of the initial human studies, nor in the crucial human efficacy trials. And nothing of the sort has been seen since these vaccines began being used more broadly in the population.</p><p>What about those animal studies, though? I think that this is a question of secondary importance, since it is obvious that the animal and human results diverge. One thing to remember is that both of the animal studies treated the animals (with either the pseudovirus or the S1 protein) by aspirating these <em>directly into their tracheas</em>, which is obviously different than the situation after vaccination. But note that the authors of the <em>Circulation Research</em> paper (the pseudovirus study) conclude by saying that &#8220;. . .<em>vaccination-generated antibody and/or exogenous antibody against S protein not only protects the host from SARS-CoV-2 infectivity but also inhibits S protein-imposed endothelial injury</em>&#8220;. They are not sounding the alarm about vaccination; they are recommending it.</p><p><strong>4. Back to the Novavax Results</strong></p><p>There is another line of argument to make. Remember, the Novavax vaccine does not cause cells to produce the Spike protein. It <em>is</em> the Spike protein, injected directly into a person&#8217;s body, along with an adjuvant to make the immune reaction that much more vigorous. It does not get cleaved to make S1 protein, because that cleavage site has been mutated to keep that from happening, but it does bind to human ACE2 receptors just like the wild-type protein. If such an injection were causing harm to patients, that would have set off a strong safety signal in the human trials, but no such problems have been seen. Not in the animal studies, not in first dose-finding studies in humans, not in the first efficacy trial, and not in the one whose results were just announced.</p><p>It seems clear from all these human trials and the clinical experience to date that the circulating levels of the S1 protein (or the Spike itself) that are sufficient to induce a protective immune response are not in themselves toxic. The animal studies demonstrate that the Spike or S1 can indeed have bad effects on living cells and tissues all by themselves, but the conditions under which this was demonstrated are not those that obtain after vaccination.</p><p>And this latest paper showing circulating S1 protein after vaccination? Coupled with the previous paper from the same group, it in fact provides strong evidence that such blood levels are not by themselves the cause of coronavirus symptoms and tissue damage. No, if you want to try for severe, permanent damage, you will need to get infected by real SARS-CoV-2 itself and take your chances. Try your luck, if you like, with the short-term symptoms and with &#8220;long Covid&#8221; symptoms as well. See if you stay out of the ICU, or if you retain your sense of smell &#8211; try  them all. If you would rather not spin that wheel, and you shouldn&#8217;t, then <em>my strong, heartfelt advice is to get vaccinated</em>. Because then you will be protected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>The post <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/15/the-novavax-vaccine-data-and-spike-proteins-in-general">The Novavax Vaccine Data, and Spike Proteins in General</a> first appeared on <a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline">In the Pipeline</a>.]]>
